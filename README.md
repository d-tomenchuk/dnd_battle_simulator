# dnd_battle_simulator
Description:

This project is a simple "DnD Battle Simulator" built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to choose a weapon and engage in a battle with a Demigorgon. The game simulates a dice roll, and the player must choose whether to attack or flee. The player's actions and dice rolls affect the outcome of the battle, with a victory if the player rolls high enough, or defeat if they fail. The game also features weapon descriptions to enhance the player's experience.
Features:

    Select from multiple weapons, each with a unique description.
    Simulate a battle with a random dice roll (D20) to determine the outcome.
    Option to flee the battle with a short result and return to the menu.
    Clean and intuitive GUI created with Tkinter.
    Battle result is displayed dynamically based on the player's choice.
